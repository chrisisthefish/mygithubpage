<p>The ornament consists of a circuit board, 6 light emitting diodes (LEDs), microcontroller, vibration sensor, 3 resistors, and a battery. You can think of the microcontroller as a tiny little computer that is running some computer code that I wrote. The microcontroller is the brains of the project and the code is what tells the ornament what to do! The vibration sensor is pretty self explanatory, as it senses vibration. The LEDs are simply little lights and the resistors make sure that the LEDs don’t have too much power flowing through them.</p>

<p>When the ornament it is sitting still it is sleeping very very deeply. It is using very little power, so it should be able to last at least several months on the small coin cell battery. When someone or something bumps the ornament, the vibration sensor is triggered. You can think of the sensor as a switch, with every vibration flipping the switch on and off several times. When the sensor is triggered, the microcontroller wakes up and runs some code I wrote that blinks the lights in one of two different patterns. The pattern is played for a set length of time, then the ornament goes back to sleep. The pattern to be displayed is switched whenever the ornament goes back to sleep</p>

<a id="pcbs-design" class="anchor" href="#pcbs-design" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PCBs Design</h3>

<p>The most interesting thing about this project for me was designing the circuit board, as I have never done anything like it before! It was quite the learning experience, as I spent many hours working on the design and starting from scratch several times before settling on a final design. Once I settled on a design, I sent the PCBs to be actually manufactured at a company here in the US. I got the first 3 boards back a few weeks later and they looked great! I soldered all of the components onto the bare PCB and powered it up, and it didn’t work! Two of the lights weren’t doing anything! After some troubleshooting, I found that I had forgotten a connection in the design. Whoops! After fixing my mistake, I sent the updated “Rev2” design to be manufactured in larger numbers from a Chinese company and after waiting about 3 weeks I got my final PCBs back.</p>

<p>After getting the PCBs back from the manufacturer, I still had to solder on all 12 of the components. At a total of 30 solder connections per board, I believe I have soldered around 570 connections in the last couple of months! If you are curious at what this 10-15 minute process looks like, check out a high-speed time-lapse video I made to show off the process:</p>
